This data was collected during 2005-2006 school year from two Portuguese secondary public school where the paper was published in 2008, So it was recent dataset for that paper.

# DATA COLLECTION AND RESOURCES:

Final version contained 37 questions and it was answered by 788 students
111 answers were discarded due to lack of identification details
Finally, the data was integrated into two datasets
related to-

1. Mathematics
2. Portuguese Language

The two datasets were modeled under 
- binary/five-level classification and 
- regression tasks. 

This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features. And it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008] 


Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful.
