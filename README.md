# Secondary School Student-Performance
Prediction of Student's performance based on social and demographic features.

* student-mat.csv is data for Mathematics course.

* student-port.csv is data for Portuguese course

* PatternLab_Report file summarizes the analysis and results.

* Project_Math_tchhabr2.ipynb jupyter file shows the code for exploratory data anaysis and machine learning algorithms for Mathematics course.

* Project_Port_tchhabr2.ipynb jupyter file shows the code for exploratory data anaysis and machine learning algorithms for Portuguese course.

* model.ipynb file shows the code is to develop a model that will predict (to a certain level of acceptable accuracy) whether a student will pass or fail a mathematics course over a year (two semesters). The features will consist of all given features within the dataset excluding the GX factors that represent semester grades. G3 will be the target feature.
